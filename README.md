# Library Management System Using MERN Stack - A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome to our Library Management System project, a robust solution for managing libraries efficiently! This project utilizes the MERN stack, combining MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. While the backend is fully functional, the frontend has been completed to provide a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A versatile JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's V8 engine.
- **Express.js**: A flexible Node.js web application framework with robust features.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database storing data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- **mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, essential for file uploads.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based service managing images and videos efficiently.
- **React.js**: A declarative and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Express Router**: Enhances code organization and modularity through the Express Router.
- **mongoose**: Simplifies MongoDB integration with a schema-based solution.
- **Multer Middleware**: Seamless handling of file uploads.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Efficient management of media files using Cloudinary.
- **React.js Frontend**: A user-friendly frontend for an enhanced experience.

## Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:

  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git


2. **Install Dependencies**:

 
   cd library-management-system
   npm install
 

3. **Set up Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```

   Replace placeholders with your MongoDB connection string and Cloudinary credentials.

4. **Run the Application**:


   npm start


   Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Routes

- **GET /availablebooks**: Retrieve a list of all books.
- **GET /books/:id**: Retrieve details of a specific book.
- **POST /postbook**: Add a new book.
- **DELETE /delete/:id**: Delete a specific book.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
